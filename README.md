# Fuel_Cost_Estimator

# App Description
The Trip Fuel Cost Estimator is a Flutter utility app that helps users calculate the estimated fuel cost for their trips. Users can input their travel distance, vehicle fuel efficiency, and fuel type to get an accurate cost estimation. The app supports multiple fuel types including Diesel, RON95, RON97, and Electric vehicles with appropriate rate adjustments.

# Input → Process → Output Explanation
*Inputs:*
- Distance - Travel distance in kilometers (km)
- Fuel Efficiency - Vehicle efficiency in kilometers per liter (km/L)
- Fuel Type - Selection from Petrol, Diesel, RON95, RON97, or Electric

*Process:*
- Parse and validate all numeric inputs using double.tryParse()
- Check for zero or negative values
- Apply fuel price based on feul type:
  1) Diesel: RM 2.89/L
  2) RON97: RM 3.14/L
  3) Electric: RM 0.70/L
  4) RON95: RM 2.60/L
- Calculate cost using formula: (Distance / Efficiency) × Price 

*Output:*
- Estimated Fuel Cost - Displayed in Malaysian Ringgit (RM) formatted to 2 decimal places
- Error messages for invalid inputs via SnackBar notifications

# Widgets Used
- Text - Labels, titles, and result display
- TextField - Distance, efficiency, and price inputs with numeric keyboard
- DropdownButton - Fuel type selection
- ElevatedButton - Calculate and Reset buttons
- Row/Column - Main layout structure for form organization
- Container - Styling with padding, margin, borders, and background colors
- Scaffold - App structure with AppBar

# Basic Validation Approach
- Null Safety: Uses double.tryParse() to handle non-numeric inputs
- Range Checking: Validates that all values are greater than zero
- User Feedback: Displays SnackBar messages for invalid inputs
- Default Handling: Resets result to 0.0 when validation fails
- Input Clearing: Reset functionality clears all fields and resets state
